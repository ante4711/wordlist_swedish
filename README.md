## A Swedish word list

This repository contains a alphabetically sorted text file containing
distinct spellings of Swedish words.

The collection has been compiled by me as a result from another larger project
I have been working on since 2007.

The only other Swedish word list I have found online before publishing this
was the Swedish list published by Openwall in 2003 at
ftp://ftp.openwall.com/pub/wordlists/languages/Swedish/

That list contained 14555 distinct spellings, but also is incorrectly encoded,
where the Swedish letters å ä and ö are encoded something like this:

broellop -> bröllop  (oe -> ö)

...

The list i am now publishing currently contains 410786 distinct spellings.

No names are included in this list.

Please contact me if you are interested in more advanced data sets, such as
full word class relations and more.
