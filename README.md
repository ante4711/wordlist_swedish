## A Swedish word list

This repository contains a alphabetically sorted text file containing
distinct spellings of Swedish words.

The collection has been compiled by me as a result from another larger project
I have been working on since 2007.


The list i am now publishing contains 410786 distinct spellings.

No names are included in this list.

Please contact me if you are interested in more advanced data sets, such as
full word class relations and more.
